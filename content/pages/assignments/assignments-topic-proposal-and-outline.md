Assessment Criteria
-------------------

*   Is the project viable?
*   Is the project interesting? (Is the question critically minded and sufficiently probing?)
*   Does the proposal reflect a rigorous effort to find relevant scholarly bibliography?
*   Is the proposal well written and generally polished?

The format for the topic proposal and outline is adapted from the {{% resource_link "96e4cbf1-deb3-4106-a138-52cfadf1b476" "Prospectus Writing Tips" %}} of the Department of History at Brown University.

The topic proposal and outline is due during Session 17.
