All papers must comply with the following presentational guidelines:

*   Papers must be 750 words in length (≈3 pages).
*   Papers must be typed in 12-point font, with at least 1½ line spacing.
*   Your paper should have a brief title; but there is no need for a title page.
*   On the short response papers, a bibliography is also unnecessary.

The papers will be worth 30% of the final grade.

Research Paper
--------------

The final paper should be a research paper of 3,000 words (≈10 to 12 pages) on a theme of your choice. Your research paper will be expected to demonstrate the skills developed in your earlier writing assignments (i.e. close analysis of ancient literary and non-literary evidence) **as well as** knowledge and understanding of as wide as possible a range of the modern works relevant to your chosen theme.

A {{% resource_link 76bd6591-210a-6aad-845c-8b5237c64598 "topic proposal and outline" %}} will be due during Session 17.

The research paper will be worth 40% of the final grade.
